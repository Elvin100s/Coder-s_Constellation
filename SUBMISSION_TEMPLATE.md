## 🎯 Project Summary

**Name:** Coders Constellation

**Problem:** African developers struggle to find meaningful collaboration. They resort to generic "Looking for collaborators" posts on WhatsApp, LinkedIn, or Twitter with little response, leading to professional isolation and missed opportunities.

**Solution:** A dedicated platform where African developers can discover projects, post collaboration requests, and connect directly via GitHub.

**Key Features:**
- Browse projects without authentication
- Search/filter by tech stack and country
- Post project ideas with clear requirements
- Direct GitHub integration for contact
- Modern, responsive UI optimized for African internet speeds

**Tech Stack:**
- Frontend: Vanilla TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- Deployment: Vercel
- Design: Modern, sleek UI with Slate/Gray + Blue accents

**Impact:**
- Addresses ALU's Grand Challenge in Economic Inclusion
- Advances Technology & Innovation opportunity
- Empowers African developers to collaborate and build together

## 📝 Notes for Grader
