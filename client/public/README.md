# Public Assets

Place your `cc.png` logo file in this directory (`client/public/cc.png`) so it can be accessed at `/cc.png` in the browser.

The logo should be:
- **Size**: Approximately 40x40 pixels (or larger, it will be scaled)
- **Format**: PNG with transparent background preferred
- **Style**: Should work well with the dark theme

The logo is used in:
- Navbar (top-left corner)
- Footer (brand section)
- Both locations have hover effects and scaling animations
